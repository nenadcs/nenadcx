# whoami
I am a dedicated and hardworking person, and I demonstrated these traits while taking night classes for a master's program last year and working full time as a Google executive simultaneously. During that time, I managed multiple commitments but delivered and performed above my expectations. Now that I've completed my degree, I'm seeking a job with more responsibilities and plan to use my strong work ethic to complete projects with a better company, like Tesla.
